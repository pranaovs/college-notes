There are n participants in a competition, participant i having a strength of s_i.

Every participant wonders how much of an advantage they have over the next strongest participant (excluding themselves). In other words, each participant i wants to know the difference between their strength s_i and the maximum strength s_j among all other participants (j != i). Note that this difference can be negative.

So, they ask you for your help! For each i (from 1 to n), calculate and output the difference s_i - max(s_j for j != i).

Input:

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) \u2014 the number of participants (length of the array).

The following line contains n space-separated positive integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_n (1 <= s_i <= 10^9) \u2014 the strengths of the participants.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Output:

For each test case, output n space-separated integers. For each i (1 <= i <= n), output the difference between s_i and the maximum strength of any other participant.
