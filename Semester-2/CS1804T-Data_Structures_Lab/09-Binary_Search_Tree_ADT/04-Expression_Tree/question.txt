Add a "construct expression tree" method to the binary tree data structure from the previous lab codeâ€”import stack from the standard template library (STL) to construct the expression tree. Import the Tree ADT program into another program that gets a valid postfix expression, constructs, and prints the expression tree. It consists of the following operations.

1. Postfix Expression
2. Construct Expression Tree
3. Preorder
4. Inorder
5. Postorder
6. Exit
