Write a C++ menu-driven program to implement List ADT using a singly linked list. You have a gethead() private member function that returns the address of the head value of a list. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The List ADT has the following operations,

1. Insert Ascending
2. Merge 
3. Display 
4. Exit

Option 1 inserts a node so the list is always in ascending order. Option 2 takes two lists as input, and merges two lists into a third list. The third list should also be in ascending order. Convert the file into a header file and include it in a C++ file. The second C++ consists of 3 lists and has the following operations,

1. Insert List1
2. Insert List2
3. Merge into List3
4. Display
5. Exit
