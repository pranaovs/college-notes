Three guys play a game: first, each person writes down n distinct words of length 3. Then, they total up the number of points as follows:

If a word was written by one person \u2014 that person gets 3 points.

If a word was written by two people \u2014 each of the two gets 1 point.

If a word was written by all three \u2014 nobody gets any points.

In the end, how many points does each player have?

Input:

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 1000) \u2014 the number of words written by each person.

The following three lines each contain n distinct strings \u2014 the words written by each person. Each string consists of 3 lowercase English characters.

Output:

For each test case, output three space-separated integers \u2014 the number of points each of the three guys earned. You should output the answers in the same order as the input; the i-th integer should be the number of points earned by the i-th guy.
