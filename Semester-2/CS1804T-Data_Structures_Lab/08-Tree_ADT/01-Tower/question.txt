There are n block towers, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th tower consists of a; blocks. In one move, you can move one block from tower i to tower j, but only if a; > a;. That move increases a; by 1 and decreases a; by 1. You can perform as many moves as you would like (possibly, zero). What's the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower 1 after the moves?

Input:

The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) - the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) — the number of towers. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ... , an (1 <= a <= 10^9) — the number of blocks on each tower. The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2^10°.

Output:

For each testcase, print the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower 1 after you make any number of moves (possibly, zero).
