A Sudoku puzzle uses a 9 × 9 grid in which each column and row, as well as each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids, must contain all of the digits 1 9. Below Figure presents an example of a valid Sudoku puzzle. This project consists of designing a multithreaded application that deter whether the solution to a Sudoku puzzle is valid. There are several different ways of multithre this application. The 9 × 9 grid value may be taken inside a 2 dimensional array. One sugg strategy is to create threads that check the following criteria:
• A thread to check that each column contains the digits 1 through 9.
• A thread to check that each row contains the digits 1 through 9.
• Nine threads to check that each of the 3 × 3 subgrids contains the digits 1 through 9.
