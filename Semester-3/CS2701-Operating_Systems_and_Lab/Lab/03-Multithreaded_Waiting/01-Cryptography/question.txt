In this task, you will create a text file containing your registration number, generate an RSA 2048-bit key pair, and sign the file with SHA-256 using your private key. The signature will be converted to Base64 format. You will also write a C program that uses process creation (fork + exec) and thread creation (pthread_create) to process the generated signature file (e.g., counting vowels in file.sig.b64). This exercise combines cryptography concepts with concurrent programming in Linux.
