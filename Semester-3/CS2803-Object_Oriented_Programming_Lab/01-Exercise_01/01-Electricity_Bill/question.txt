Develop a Java application to generate an electricity bill. Create a class with the following members: Consumer number, consumer name, previous month reading, current month reading, and type of EB connection (i.e., domestic or commercial). Compute the bill amount using the following tariff.

If the type of the EB connection is domestic, calculate the amount to be paid as follows:
For the first 100 units, the rate is Rs. 1 per unit.
For 101 to 200 units, the rate is Rs. 2.50 per unit.
For 201 to 500 units, the rate is Rs. 4 per unit.
For units above 500, the rate is Rs. 6 per unit.

If the type of the EB connection is commercial, calculate the amount to be paid as follows:
For the first 100 units, the rate is Rs. 2 per unit.
For 101 to 200 units, the rate is Rs. 4.50 per unit.
For 201 to 500 units, the rate is Rs. 6 per unit.
For units above 500, the rate is Rs. 7 per unit.
