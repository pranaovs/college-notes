Implement DES from scratch:
Key schedule (support 56-bit key; you may accept 64-bit input but ignore parity bits or validate them).

Initial Permutation (IP) and final permutation (IP^-1).

16 Feistel rounds using E expansion, all 8 S-boxes, P-permutation, and round subkeys.
Implement single-block encryption and decryption functions that operate on exactly one 64-bit block (8 bytes).

Unit tests: include canonical test vector:
Key: 133457799BBCDFF1
Plaintext: 0123456789ABCDEF
